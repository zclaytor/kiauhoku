'''
eep.py

Utilities to downsample stellar evolution tracks to Equivalent Evolutionary
Phase (EEP) basis, according to the method of Dotter (2016). 

The default EEP functions are contained in eep.default_eep_functions. They are
    default_eep_functions = {
        'prems': get_PreMS,
        'zams': get_ZAMS,
        'eams': get_EAMS,
        'iams': get_IAMS,
        'tams': get_TAMS,
        'rgbump': get_RGBump,
    }

You can define and supply your own EEP functions in a dictionary. 
EEP functions must have the call signature
    function(track, eep_params)
where `track` is a single track.

def _eep_interpolate(track, eep_params, eep_functions, metric_function=None):
    '''
    Given a raw evolutionary track, returns a downsampled track based on
    Equivalent Evolutionary Phases (EEPs). The primary EEPs are defined below,
    and the default ones to use in the computation are listed in
    eep.default_eep_functions. The secondary EEPs are computed based on the
    number of secondary EEPs between each pair of primary EEPs as specified
    in `eep_params.intervals`; these should be defined in the grid
    installation file. If one of the EEP_intervals is 200, then for that pair
    of primary EEPs, the metric distance between those primary EEPs is divided
    into 200 equally spaced points, and the relevant stellar parameters are
    linearly interpolated at those points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    track (StarGrid): single-index StarGrid to be interpolated.

    eep_params (dict): dictionary of column names to use in EEP computation, 
        as well as secondary EEP intervals.

    eep_functions (dict): dictionary of callables to use for EEP computation.

    metric_function (callable, optional): function to compute EEP intervals.
        If none is specified, eep._HRD_distance will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    eep_track, a pandas DataFrame containing the EEP-based track.
